A pure C implementation of the method.

The following two lines generate a mesh from a signed distance bound specified in `scenes/primitives.c`:

	bash build.sh scenes/primitives.c
	./exe 128 model.stl

This tool does not support the visualization of generated meshes.
Please use some other software for this.
