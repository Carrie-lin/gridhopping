This project contains the implementation of a method for fast polygonization of signed distance bounds and a tiny CAD tool based on it.
Its main applications are (1) constructive solid geometry (CSG) and (2) generating triangle approximations of 3D fractals.

The core feature of this CAD software is that you do not have a visual editor for builidng 3D models, but you write code (JavaScript or C) to describe them.

## Contents of the repo

* a web-based implementation is in the folder [javascript](javascript) (try it at <https://femtocad.gitlab.io>);
* a native implementation is in the folder [native](native);
* a description of the algorithm running under the hood is available [here](algo.md).
